%In the beginning : 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item \cite{grossman1981nash} and \cite{hart1982imperfect} : SFE without uncertainty, large multiplicity
%\item \cite{klemperer1986price} : firms choose to compete in price or quantity, in the presence of uncertainty the number of equilibria is reduced
%\end{itemize}
%
%Seminal paper : 
%\cite{KM}
%
%Questions of applicability :
%\cite{von1993spot} : step functions of finite length are different to continuous functions
%
%Applications using simpler model : overcomes multiplicity, and aims at computational tractability
%\cite{borenstein1999empirical} : Cournot model estimated for the california market, finds increase in price when demand is high
%\cite{green1996increasing} : focuses on the linear supply solution out of the SFE multiple equilbria in order to have analytical tractable forms and study the effect of three policies
%\cite{hobbs2000strategic} : transmission constraints taken into account, with affine supply
